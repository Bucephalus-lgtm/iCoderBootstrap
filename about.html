                <p class="lead">Some of their descendants in later times in order to dignify their familes asserted that they
had a family connection with the great Yaishnava reformer SaiikaradeYa. Accordingly the author of Adi-charitra represented Kaunajavara the eldest son of Samanta as the father of Chaadivara the great-grand father of Sankaradeva. But really Chaadivara was the son of Laiidadeva, and not La^dadeva btit Chandivara himself had migrated to Assam from Gauda. He had no connexion whatever with the family of the Adi-Bhiiiyas. The books written by Sankaradeva himself conclusively proves this. The Adi-Bhuiyas
were originally worshippers of the goddess Sakti. One branch of them subsequently was conrerted into Vaishnavism and thus separated
itself from the others. According to the Adi
charitra, the family of Santanu settled at Lakshmipur (now Lakhimpur) on the northern bank of the Brahmaputra and that of Sumantra
 at Ramapur (now Rangpur in Sibsagar District) on the southern bank of the same river. When the twelve brothers were reigning at Lakshmipur the king of Chhutia came to them and asked them to make him their king. But they scornfully refused the proposal. Thereupon the king of Chhutia declared war against them. But his enemies fought very heroically against him and inflicted a defeat upon him. Next the king of Kachari wanted to be their king. But as the Bhuiyas did not agree to the proposal, he marched against them with a large army. This time also the Bhuiyas acquitted themselves creditably and drove away the invader. In this way the Bhifiyas ruled the place for about seventy years. At this stage Chaturanga (Sukhafigpha) of the Ahom dynasty defeated the Bhuiyas at a place called Chargoa and took possession of Lakshmipur. At first the Bhuiyas were quite tmwdlling to acknowledge the suzerainty of their enemy. But, when they were taken before the goddess Kali at Sadiya for sacrifice, they agreed to pay homage to their conqueror and thus saved their lives. Subsequently they helped the Ahom king to defeat the kings of Chhutia and Kachari and became very favourite to him. Their descendants served under the Ahom kings and lived at Lakhimpur and Sadia and the neighbouring places.*^ The descendants of the Adi-Bhwiyas are now to be found in many places in Upper Assam. But all their influence passed away on account of the decrease of the power of the Ahems and owing to the oppression committed upon them by the Mans.

                <p class="lead">In the Dharmamafigala Kamta-gada has been likened to the city of Lanka as it had a deep moat around it and was also surrounded by a great river.12 Here LSusena halted at a place on the bank of this great river called Deuldlghi. Hari, the father-in law of Dhala Raya started on an elephant and Bhagavan Datta his commander-in-chief on horseback to meet him.13 Both sides fought furiously. Dhala Raya was defeated and captured by Kalu, the general of Lausena. All the Dharmamafigalas say that Safula or Samula, the mother of the king of Gauda, had a wonderful dagger that was invincible and that it w^as with the help of this weapon that Lausena was able to inflict a defeat on his adversary. Dhala Raya had his capital at a place called Kamta-gada or fort of Kamta. He paid to his suzerain tribute for twenty one years and made peace with him. He and his daughter Kalinga were
devoted worshippers of the goddess Kalika.
Ill pursuance of the order of the goddess, Kalifiga placed the marriage-garland round the neck of Lausena. This marriage was celebrated according to vedic rites and the mantras prescribed in the Vedangas were used
by the parties to it. It took place in the capital of Dhala Raya. The ruins of this city are to be found at a place now called Gosanimari standing on the river
Singimari at a distance of fourteen miles from the capital of modern Koch Bihar. It was protected by a deep moat and was also surrounded by a large river.</p>

                <p class="lead">The extensive ruins of Kamtapur still Rains of bear testimoney to the truth of the above KimUpur description given in the Dharmamangala. Babu Harendranarayan Chaudhuri, the late State Judge of Koch Bihar thus writes of the place in his book called 'The Cooch Behar State'— "The remains of the city of Kamtapur are gigantic works of human art and bespeak great power and wealth in the Prince or Princes who conceived such an idea of a capital. The city was of a triangular shape, long from east to west, with a perimeter of about 20 miles. The two sides of this triangle met in the west, and were defended by a high rampart
part, protected by an inner ditch and an outer moat, and covering a length of about 15 miles, while the old Dharla formed the base about 5 miles long and protected in the east from foreign invasion. There were two redoubts, one towards the north-east and the Ruins of other towards the north-west. The rampart K4mta was pierced by four gates of huge proportions, in the north, south and west. The northern gate was called the Hoko-duar. The sides of the rampart here at the gate-way were faced with bricks in mortar, which are still in good condition. The gate in the south was called the Sil-duar or stone-gate, and it cut the rampart in an S curve... It is said that the rampart at this gate-way was lines with stones, and that the gate had a door-way of stone. Several large slabs of granite are still lying in it and a few are yet standing. From this gate issued a high embanked road, which leading through Rangpur went as far as Ghoraghat, which at the time marked the southern boundry of old Kamrup."i6 Now Kamtapur is nothing but a heap of ruins. More than a century ago Dr. Buchanan Hamilton visited this place. But many of the things he saw here do not exist now.</p>
